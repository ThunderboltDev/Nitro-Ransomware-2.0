## IMPORTANT NOTICE: RANSOMWARE AND ITS UNLAWFUL NATURE
Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to encrypt files or lock computer systems, holding them hostage until a ransom is paid. Building or spreading ransomware is illegal and highly unethical. It is crucial to understand that engaging in such activities can have severe legal consequences.

Participating in the creation, distribution, or use of ransomware violates numerous laws and regulations worldwide, including but not limited to computer fraud, extortion, and unauthorized access to computer systems. These actions can lead to criminal charges, hefty fines, and imprisonment.

It is essential to prioritize ethical behavior and use programming skills responsibly. As aspiring developers, we must promote cybersecurity, protect individuals' privacy, and contribute positively to society. Remember, the best way to grow and excel in the field of technology is through lawful and ethical practices.

Please use this information responsibly, for educational purposes only, and always adhere to the legal and ethical guidelines that govern your jurisdiction.
